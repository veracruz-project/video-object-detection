# Video object detection example

This example combines and integrates two simpler examples, the video decoder and the [deep learning server](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz-examples/tree/main/deep-learning-server).  
The video decoder uses [`openh264`](https://github.com/veracruz-project/openh264) to decode an H264 video into individual frames, which are converted to RGB and made palatable to an object detector built on top of the [Darknet neural network framework](https://github.com/veracruz-project/darknet). The output is a list of detected objects, associated with their detection probability, and an optional prediction image showing each detected object in a bounding box.

## Build and setup
* Install [`wasi sdk 14`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) and set `WASI_SDK_ROOT` to point to its installation directory:
  ``` bash ci-build
  $ export WASI_VERSION=14; \
  export WASI_VERSION_FULL=${WASI_VERSION}.0; \
  wget https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-${WASI_VERSION}/wasi-sdk-${WASI_VERSION_FULL}-linux.tar.gz; \
  tar xvf wasi-sdk-${WASI_VERSION_FULL}-linux.tar.gz; \
  echo "export WASI_SDK_ROOT=\"${PWD}/wasi-sdk-${WASI_VERSION_FULL}\"" >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
* Install `imagemagick` and `nasm` (Ubuntu):
  ``` bash ci-build
  $ apt-get update && apt-get install -y imagemagick nasm
  ```
* Clone the repo and update the submodules:
  ``` bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection -b main && \
  cd video-object-detection && \
  git submodule update --init
  ```
* Build [`openh264`](https://github.com/veracruz-project/openh264), [`openh264-dec`](https://github.com/veracruz-project/openh264-dec), [`darknet`](https://github.com/veracruz-project/darknet) and the main program (VOD) to WebAssembly:
  ``` bash ci-build
  $ make
  ```
* Build VOD as a native binary (optional):
  ``` bash ci-build
  $ make -f Makefile_native
  ```
* Download the YOLO models and configuration files and the COCO object list:
  ``` bash ci-build
  $ wget -P program_data \
  https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/yolo3.weights \
  https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/yolo3-tiny.weights \
  https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/yolo3.cfg \
  https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/yolo3-tiny.cfg \
  https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/coco.names
  ```
* Generate the alphabet (optional):
  ``` bash
  $ make generate_alphabet
  ```

## Prepare the input video (optional)
* Cut the MP4 video to a specific amount of frames (optional):
  ``` bash
  $ ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vf trim=start_frame=0:end_frame=<END_FRAME> -an in_cut.mp4
  ```
* Generate the input H.264 video from the MP4 video:
  ``` bash
  $ ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -map 0:0 -vcodec copy -an -f h264 in.h264
  ```
* Note that an example H264 video is available in the release assets:
  ``` bash ci-video
  $ mkdir -p video_input && \
  wget -P video_input https://github.com/veracruz-project/video-object-detection/releases/download/20230406/in.h264
  ```

## File tree
* The program is expecting the following file tree:
  ```
  + output/           (prediction images outputted by the program)
  + program_data/     (data read by the program)
  +-- coco.names      (list of detectable objects)
  +-- labels/         (alphabet (optional))
  +---- *.png
  +-- yolov3.cfg      (configuration)
  +-- yolov3.weights  (model)
  + video_input/
  +-- in.h264         (H264 video)
  ```

## Execution outside Veracruz
Running the program outside Veracruz is useful to validate the program without considering the policy and the TEE backend it runs on.  
There are several ways to do that. In any case the [file tree](#file-tree) must be mirrored on the executing machine.

### As a standalone native binary
* Build as a native binary (cf. build steps above)
* Run:
  ``` bash ci-run-native
  $ mkdir output
  ./detector
  ```

### As a WebAssembly binary in `wasmtime`
* Install [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime):
  ``` bash ci-run-wasmtime
  $ curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash && \
  . ~/.bashrc
  ```
* Run:
  ``` bash ci-run-wasmtime
  $ mkdir output
  wasmtime --dir=. detector.wasm
  ```

### As a WebAssembly binary in the [`freestanding execution engine`](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz/tree/main/sdk/freestanding-execution-engine)
* Run:
  ``` bash ci-run-fee
  $ mkdir program
  cp detector.wasm program
  mkdir output
  RUST_LOG=info RUST_BACKTRACE=1 freestanding-execution-engine -i video_input program program_data -o output -r program/detector.wasm -x jit -c -d -e
  ```

## End-to-end Veracruz deployment
An application (program, data and policy) can't be validated until the program and data are provisioned by a Veracruz client to the Runtime Manager, the policy gets verified and the program successfully executes within the enclave.  
The crux of an end-to-end deployment is to get the policy file right. To that end, a collection of deployment scripts are provided and take care of generating the certificates and the policy based on the program's [file tree](#file-tree).
* [Build Veracruz](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz/blob/main/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.markdown)
* Depending on your environment, run `./deploy_linux.sh` or `./deploy_nitro.sh` inside a Docker container (the same as the one used to build Veracruz) to generate the policy, deploy the Veracruz components and run the computation
* The prediction images can be found in the executing directory
